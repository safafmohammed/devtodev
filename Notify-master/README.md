Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) allows you to send push notifications directly from Firebase console or with an app server or some other trusted environment where the server logic runs. However, you may want to send push notifications between devices, like in most chat apps, but without writing any server-side code. Of course, itâ€™s very possible.

- Firebase account (sign up here)  
- Basic knowledge of Android development
